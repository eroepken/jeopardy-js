# Jeopardy! JS

This is a Jeopardy! game built on React, Webpack and Babel, with hot reloading. Currently, the features include:
* An accurate game board
* The ability to click on dollar values to see clues and toggle answers

Aspirations for future versions:
* Moderator companion page to be loaded in a separate window (keep track of scores, add/subtract wagers, and see/manage the clues/answers without showing players)
* The ability to use an external data source rather than manually adding JSON data.

## Installation
* `git clone git@github.com:eroepken/jeopardy-js.git`
* cd jeopardy-js
* npm install
* npm start
* visit `http://localhost:8080/`
